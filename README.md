-This is a program that makes a very simple version of text based blackjack including betting. 
The module 1 concepts used include classes, overloaded constructors, and pointers.
-This program could be greatly expanded and this is a very simple iteration of blackjack. Expansions could include deck of card simulation
instead of just a random number generator. Blackjack concepts such as splitting and doubling down. 
Or a tutorial of some kind giving you a helping hand when playing. Also, aces should be made to be a 1 or a 17.
-The only known bug in the code is a result of the card number generator logic. It is theoretically possible to be dealt two 11s 
giving you 22 making you instantly lose.
-There is no code not written by me but the line cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); was written by a TA taken from stackoverflow.
-I believe that this project has earned in the 70-80 point range as I have included a robust and complicated main class and utilized multiple
module 1 concepts, but also the program does have very simple logic and has a lot of room for improvement. Additionally, I only committed 6 days before the
project was due instead of 7, so I lose points there.
