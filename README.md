# M1OEP-cfoot
Requirements
• All of your programming files should be in a private GitHub repository in the course organization.
- Your repository must be named with the convention: M1OEP-netid, where netid is your UVM
  NetID username.
- The repository should have a .gitignore file, a CMakeLists.txt file, and a README file (see the
  GitHub-with-CLion repo for directions).
  • Your README.md file should include:
- Your name
- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 1 concepts used
- Any known bugs at time of submission
- Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
- Citations for any code not written by you or the instructor
- The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric below, with justification
  • All of your files must be pushed to your GitHub repository.
  • Create a short video (~5 minutes) giving a brief overview of the program, including a demo.
- You can record the video on Microsoft Teams or a different program of your choosing. Instructions
  to record in Teams are at the bottom of this spec.
  • Submit both the link to your repository and the link to your video.
- You can upload your video to OneDrive or a different platform of your choosing to obtain a link.
  Main Program
  Your main program should have a clear and complex purpose. It should not be used as a testing file to
  call methods and functions. The goals and functionality of your program should inform the development
  and design of your class(es) and other concepts. You are highly encouraged to plan and design your
  main.cpp functionality before writing your other files.
  The program should be interactive and all user input must be validated.
  Keep in mind that you will be allowed and encouraged to build on this project for future modules’ open-
  ended projects, so putting the time in now to construct a strong foundation will be to your advantage.
  Module 1 Concept Menu
  You can include any number and combination of these C++ concepts from Module 1:
  • Class (separated into header and .cpp files, containing at least two fields and at least one method
  that isn’t a constructor, getter, setter, or destructor)
  • Overloaded Operator(s) in your class(es)
  • Enumerated type(s)
  • Struct(s)
  All of the above concepts that you design, create, and use in your main program must be clearly listed
  in your README.md file.
